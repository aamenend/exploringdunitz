&nbsp; An average suburban neighborhood nestled in Southern California, far enough away from Downtown to avoid the major traffic. A tranquil neighborhood with beautiful houses, this city provided a sanctuary for the community that called it a home. Many people viewed this city as the key to the American dream that they strived for so badly. This city was Compton, California. The image of Compton has been infamously linked to images of violence and gangs by outsiders, which has not only effected the citizens but has overshadowed the demographic shift and hopes of a city slowly returning to the suburban neighborhood it once was. To understand the tensions and issues that Compton has experienced, it is important to look back on this history of how the city began. A major influence on the way a community is viewed on a larger scale and how a community views itself, is influenced by the way it is portrayed in the media as well as the art that emerges from it. Facing hardships from the outside world, Compton is also effected by the internal struggle among parts of its community, yet members still come together to strive to make the city the suburban dream it once was. 

The history of Compton has been lost to images that have become synonymous with the violence. So much so, that many do not know how the city developed. It was seen as a means to achieve the American dream that so many desired. In the 1920’s Compton was a seemingly insignificant city, blending in with the other working class suburbs in the area. “The city held the alias as the Industrial Heart of the California Southland a small city with more than enough industrial jobs to supply its residents and those in nearby cities” (Marshall, 2016). Much of the complex history that provides the backdrop for what the city has become has been forgotten, yet in the past the city experienced a demographic shift from a predominately white neighborhood to a predominately black one. The past may have some reflection on the tensions and issues the city is experiencing now.  Beginning as a white neighborhood, the city slowly transitioned into an “exemplary African American suburb” (Sides, 2004). Currently Compton has transitioned from a majority black community to one with a majority Latino population.
	
&nbsp; Deadly shooting results in death of two teens, man charged with murder, gang violence erupts in streets, links to illegal drug operations. These are all the common headlines that appear in news reports and other media linked to the city of Compton. Major Aja Brown remarked on the infamous perception of Compton by stating, “Our violent crime has gone down 50 percent… and over the last 20 years, crime is down 71 percent” (Jennings et al, 2015). Major Aja Brown herself is a symbol of the changes that have occurred in Compton over the years. The youngest major to ever hold the office in the city, she has brought a fresh perspective and hope, and has made efforts to restore a positive image to the city she calls home. Despite there being a decrease in crime, including murder, media is stuck on the past when it comes to Compton. Rather than showing the development and strides made, the city remains synonymous with the word violence to outsiders. Negative media portal off Compton not only effects outsiders view of the city, but also damages the self-perceptions of the individuals living there. 

&nbsp; Known as “stereotype threat,” research has shown that an induvial that is part of a stereotyped group “experience[s] a number of effects that reduce performance” (The Opportunity Agenda, 2011). “Increased anxiety, self-consciousness about performance, and efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions all use up mental resources needed to perform well on cognitive and social tasks “ (The Opportunity Agenda, 2011). Black males are especially subjected to and conscious of the stereotypes reinforced through the media, where they are often times depicted as unintelligent, violent, and less accomplished individuals. This is especially true in depictions of Compton. As the stereotypes of minority groups are reinforced in the media, they are also reinforced in the minds of the individuals. The stereotype of being less educated and underachieving and the threat of it is reflected in the education levels in Compton, as only 8.8% have a Bachelor’s degree or higher (Census Reporter). That stereotypes that media reinforces on Compton effect those living there and skew the view outsiders have towards the city, yet the art that has emerged from Compton has also played a key role in portraying the city. 

&nbsp; The art that emerges from a city captures a moment in that time, as it is a reflection of life and the life of those who produced or created it. For many, Compton became widely known when the rap group N.W.A emerged in the music scene in the 80’s. Rapping about racial issues, police violence, and surviving in Compton, the five young teenagers made Compton legendary. The still lasting influence and impression that artists had on the city can still be seen in Compton, as there is a large mural paying tribute to Eazy-E. Their music was reflective of the time they were living in, rapping “Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off” (N.W.A.,1988). N.W.A. became so popular because they were a group of young kids that spoke honestly about what occurred in their everyday lives. They brought the issues that Compton and other people of color in similar cities were experiencing to national attention. Their story remains not only a story of truth for that moment in time, but as inspiration for the success that can be achieved by individuals from Compton. The image of Compton emerged in this time period, during “gang feuds, civil unrest, and the crack epidemic” (Takahashi, 2015) and the international image has not changed with the city as it has changed. Compton’s “soundtrack may always be rap, but today it’s a different type of beat” (Takahashi, 2015). The outsiders view of Compton needs to develop in the same way the city has, a view more reflective of the contemporary on goings in the city needs to be established.

&nbsp; Demographics have a large influence on a city, creating challenges, influencing ideas, and changing the future trajectory. Despite the global perception that Compton is a largely black community, there has been a demographic shift in the city and it is no longer the historically black neighborhood it used to be.  66% of the population of Compton is Hispanic, 31% of it is Black, and 1% is White (Census Reporter). These numbers are drastically different than the past, and with a shift in race Compton has also seen a shift in the on-goings of the city itself. Compton has gone through a shift like this in the past, when it went from being mostly white to black. Despite a majority in population, Latino’s still lack political representation. A professor of political science and Chicana/o Studies at Loyola Marymount University, Fernando Guerra stated “Latinos have always been able to count on African-American support on major (civil rights) issues, but what happens at the local level… not as much” (Nasser, 2013). The history of Compton is largely influenced by the civil rights struggle from the black community, and Compton has been the black community’s neighborhood for years, and has been influenced by their culture and their interests. With the history of the city largely influenced by the rights struggle from the black community, they seem very unwilling to hand over or share the power and representation they took so long to achieve. The parts of the Latino community seem unwilling to integrate culturally and politically in the city of Compton as well. 
	
&nbsp; Much of the change and progression that is occurring in Compton is a result of the strong commitment form people in the community who want to see their city and the members of it flourish despite sometimes formidable circumstances. The history of the Compton Unified School District  (CUSD) is one plagued by corruption and misconduct, which effected and continues to effect the students that attend. Due the financial crisis that had developed and resulted in Compton students having the lowest academic performance in the state, CUSD became the first district in California that the state took over to control (Sentilles, 2006). Education has long been seen as a tool and one of the main keys to achieving a brighter future. The school district in Compton was failing so badly it was reflected in the struggle the students that attended had academically. If education is the basis of a productive, successful life, Compton fell into a vicious cycle that did not provide the youth a means to break out and obtain the success that outsiders viewed as impossible for them. Public schools remain an issue in Compton to this day, but rather than passively accept the failure of the school district, the community has taken a stand to ensure the success of the future for the city. Parents decided to come together and fight for the better education of their children, and petitioned for change in the school using the “California’s parent trigger law” (Newton, 2011) and despite daunting opposition. Parents who have struggled their entire lives see education as the means for their children to have better lives then they’re own, and took it upon themselves to make a difference in not only their community but their children’s lives. Parents are not the only members of the community that are take the initiative to bring about change in the city they call home. 

&nbsp; A reoccurring theme when it comes to Compton is violence. As violence is what brought Compton’s name to the national level and it is the concept that still remains synonymous with the name of the city. Most American’s have some knowledge about the two most notorious gangs in Compton, the Bloods and the Crips, yet little know that even they have decided to look at the bigger picture and focus on the success of their community rather than the success of their respective gang. Mayor Aja Brown remarked on the truce between the gangs, stating “It’s real redemption when you can have people who were notorious for tearing down their community helping to build it up” (Allen, 2014). And build it up they have, as the residential property market has increased by 10% in 2014 as people decided to move to more reasonably priced neighborhood (Allen, 2014). The truce that has occurred between the two major notorious gangs in Compton has not only lead to a safer city, but has also positively influenced the economy. People are more likely to move to a city where there is less violence. Compton also provides well priced housing, partly due to this infamous title and past it carries, which is now motivating people to buy houses in the city. Compton is slowly beginning to move away from its violent filled past, towards the suburban community that it was and is at its roots. The focus on community development can also be seen in the grassroot organizations. 

&nbsp; Compton is now on the path to re-development, as collective action is being taken to make a difference and bring about reform in the city. This such action is directly motivated by grassroot movements and organizations located in the city that share the mutual goal of improving the community and the lives of those living there. One such organization is Unearth and Empower Communities, a non-profit that started in 2008 aimed at “strengthening the areas of literacy, arts education, mentoring, and entrepreneurship” (Unearth and Empower, 2017). This organization, and such like it , are aimed at uniting the local community by working with the residents and officials to address issues. Unearth and Empower provides the lessons that can be used by the residents of a city in order to achieve the transformation so desired. The Compton Initiative is another such non-profit that was founded in 2006 on the principle of restoring Compton by painting buildings in the community with the assistance of volunteers (The Compton Initiative). Though painting buildings might seem like a minute action, especially when there appear to be more pressing significant issues that the community faces. But the new paint not only restores that neighborhood and beautifies it, but can be seen a symbol for the re-birth of a city that has faced such hardships in the past. A fresh paint is an outwardly expression of the new hope the city has in its future, and the act itself further brings together the community. 

&nbsp; The current issues and progression found in Compton has been greatly impacted by the intricate history of the city. Largely forgotten, the city once used to be seen as the dream goal for many people across the country who moved to the city to achieve their American dream. Worldwide the views of Compton are closely linked to the gangs, violence, and issues is experienced in the 80’s, and the media is still stuck on focusing on the violence that once was. These views of Compton not only make it a city many people don’t want to visit or move to, it also effects how the citizens of Compton view themselves. The city has experienced a large change not only with its demographic shift, but also the decrease in violence and the initiatives of the members of the community to transform the city. Outsiders only view the city as filled with violence and gangs, which has overshadowed the strides of a city developing into an attractive city. Compton once was a quite suburban neighborhood that attracted individuals from across the country, and this is what the city hopes to become once again.
