With the sun shining majority of the year and an abundance of jobs, this suburban neighborhood fit the image of the ideal city to raise your family. Located at a distance far enough away from the hustle and the constant hum of running car engines that accompanies downtown life. A tranquil and serene atmosphere surrounded the city. Beautiful houses lined the streets and provided a sanctuary for the community that called the city home. Many people viewed this city as the key to the American dream that they strived for so badly. This city was Compton, California. The Compton of today does not align with the idealistic neighborhood you just imagined. The third world perception of Compton from non-residents warps the locals and overshadows the demographic shift and hopes of a city slowly returning to the ideal suburban neighborhood of the past.  Looking back towards how the city began sheds light and a deeper understanding on the issues Compton currently faces and those that it faced in the past. Mix media influences the global and self-perception of a community. Members of the city overcome not only hardships form the outside world but internal struggle, yet through the improvement of Compton they come together united with the goal of restoring it to the suburban dream. 

Concentrated on the violence synonymously linked to Compton, people overlook its diverse history. Historically Compton was viewed as the means to achieve the American dream that so many desired. In the 1920’s Compton was a seemingly insignificant city, blending in with the other working class suburbs in the area. “The city held the alias as the Industrial Heart of the California Southland; a small city with more than enough industrial jobs to supply its residents and those in nearby cities” (Marshall, 2016). Much of the complex history that provides the backdrop for what the city transformed into goes forgotten, yet in the past the city experienced a demographic shift from a predominately white neighborhood to a predominately black one. The past may have some reflection on the tensions and issues the city experiences now. Beginning as a white neighborhood, the city slowly transitioned into an “exemplary African American suburb” (Sides, 2004) after court rulings eradicated housing covenants that restricted people of color from renting or buying homes (Sides, 2004). Currently Compton has transitioned from a majority black community to one with a majority Latino population. The intricate history of Compton is lost to the violence the media focuses on, perpetuating Compton’s infamous title as one of the most violent cities in the United States.

Despite there being a decrease in crime, including murder, media continues to report on the violent activities rather than the progress. “Deadly shooting results in death of two teens”, “man charged with murder”, “gang violence erupts in streets”, “links to illegal drug operations.” These are all the common headlines that appear in news reports and other media linked to the city of Compton. Major Aja Brown remarked on the infamous perception of Compton by stating, “Our violent crime has gone down 50 percent… and over the last 20 years, crime is down 71 percent” (Takahashi, 2015). Major Aja Brown herself serves as a symbol of the changes that have occurred in Compton over the years. The youngest major to ever hold the office in the city, she brings a fresh perspective and hope, and has made efforts to restore a positive image to the city she calls home. Rather than showing the development and strides made, the city remains synonymous with the word “violence” to outsiders. Negative media portal off Compton not only affects outsiders view of the city, but also damages the self-perceptions of the individuals living there. 

Individuals are adversely impacted by the negative labeling of the city they are from or by being linked to a poor perception based on their demographics. Known as “stereotype threat,” research has shown that an individual that is part of a stereotyped group “experience[s] a number of effects that reduce performance” (The Opportunity Agenda, 2011). “Increased anxiety, self-consciousness about performance, and efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions all use up mental resources needed to perform well on cognitive and social tasks” (The Opportunity Agenda, 2011). Black males are especially subjected to and conscious of the stereotypes reinforced through the media, where they are often times depicted as unintelligent, violent, and less accomplished individuals. This is especially true in depictions of Compton. As the stereotypes of minority groups are reinforced in the media, they are also reinforced in the minds of the individuals. The education levels in Compton reflect the damaging impacts of the stereotype of being less educated and underachieving, as only 8.8% have a Bachelor’s degree or higher (Census Reporter, 2018). The stereotypes that media reinforces about Compton impact those living there and skew the view outsiders have towards the city, yet the art that has emerged from Compton has also played a key role in portraying the city.  

The art that emerges from a city captures a moment in that time, providing a reflection of life and the life of those who produced or created it. For many, Compton became widely known when the rap group N.W.A emerged in the music scene in the 80’s. Rapping about racial issues, police violence, and surviving in Compton, the five young teenagers made Compton legendary. The lasting influence and impression that these artists had on the city can still be seen in Compton, with a large mural paying tribute to Eazy-E. Their music reflected the atmosphere they grew up in, rapping “Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off” (Cube, Paterson, & Curry, 1988). N.W.A. became so popular because the group consisted of young kids that spoke honestly about what occurred in their everyday lives. They brought the issues experienced by the residents of Compton and other people of color in similar cities to national attention. Their story remains not only a story of truth for that moment in time, but serves as an inspiration for the success that can be achieved by individuals from Compton. The image of Compton emerged in this time period, during “gang feuds, civil unrest, and the crack epidemic” (Takahashi, 2015) and the international image of the past remains as the city itself changes. Compton’s “soundtrack may always be rap, but today it’s a different type of beat” (Takahashi, 2015). The outsiders view of Compton needs to demonstrate the new development of the city, a view more reflective of the contemporary on goings in the city needs to be established.

Demographics largely influence a city, creating challenges, shaping ideas, and changing the future trajectory. Despite the global perception that Compton’s population consists of a largely black community, a demographic shift occurred in the city and altered the historically black neighborhood.  Sixty six percent of the population of Compton is Hispanic, 31% Black, and 1% White (Census Reporter, 2018). These numbers are drastically different than the past, and with a shift in race Compton experienced a shift socially, culturally, and politically. The bi-lingual signs found across Compton serve as an outwardly expression of the demographic change. Despite a majority in population, Latinos still lack political representation. A professor of political science and Chicana/o Studies at Loyola Marymount University, Fernando Guerra stated, “Latinos have always been able to count on African-American support on major (civil rights) issues, but what happens at the local level… not as much” (El Nasser, 2013). The civil rights struggle form the black community heavy influenced the history of Compton, the black community’s culture and interest also molded the city. With the history of the city fundamentally shaped by the rights struggle from the black community, they seem very unwilling to hand over or share the power and representation they took so long to achieve. Parts of the Latino community seem unwilling to integrate culturally and politically as well, as they have become marginalized by the predominately black city government. Despite internal tensions in the community, several residents continue to band together to aid their city.

Much of the change and progression that is occurring in Compton is a result of the strong commitment from people in the community who want to see their city and the members of it flourish despite sometimes formidable circumstances. Corruption and misconduct plague the history of the Compton Unified School District (CUSD), which affected and continues to negatively affect the students that attend. Due to the financial crisis that had developed and resulted in Compton students having the lowest academic performance in the state, CUSD became the first district in California that the state took control over (Sentilles, 2006). Education has long been seen as a tool and one of the main keys to achieving a brighter future. The academic struggle of the students reflected the failure of the school district in Compton. If education is the basis of a productive, successful life, Compton fell into a vicious cycle that did not provide the youth a means to break out and obtain the success that outsiders viewed as impossible for them. Public schools remain an issue in Compton to this day, but rather than passively accepting the failure of the school district, the community has taken a stand to ensure the success of the future for the city. Parents decided to come together and fight for the better education of their children, and petitioned for change in the school using the “California’s parent trigger law” (Newton, 2011) and despite daunting opposition. Parents who have struggled their entire lives see education as the means for their children to have better lives than their own, and took it upon themselves to make a difference in not only their community but their children’s lives. Parents are not the only members of the community taking the initiative to bring about change, even past perpetrators of the cycle of violence seen in Compton are taking strides to better the city they call home. 

Violence remains a reoccurring theme when it comes to Compton. As violence brought Compton’s name to the national level and remains synonymous with the name of the city. Most American’s have some knowledge about the two most notorious gangs in Compton, the Bloods and the Crips, yet little know that even they have decided to look at the bigger picture and focus on the success of their community rather than the success of their respective gang. Mayor Aja Brown remarked on the truce between the gangs, stating “It’s real redemption when you can have people who were notorious for tearing down their community helping to build it up” (Allen, 2014). And build it up they have, as the residential property market has increased by 10% in 2014 people decided to move to a more reasonably priced neighborhood (Allen, 2014). The truce between the two major notorious gangs in Compton has not only led to a safer city, but also positively influenced the economy. People are more likely to move to a city with lower crime rates. Compton also provides well priced housing, partly due to this infamous title and the past it carries, which now motivates people to buy houses in the city. Compton is slowly beginning to move away from its violent filled past, towards the suburban community of its roots. Grassroot organizations also serve as a pillar for community development in the city.

Compton continues on the path to re-development, as residents take collective action to make a difference and bring about reform in the city. Grassroot movements and organizations located in the city unite with the shared goal of improving the community and the lives of those living there. One such organization is Unearth and Empower Communities, a non-profit that started in 2008 aimed at “strengthening the areas of literacy, arts education, mentoring, and entrepreneurship” (Unearth and Empower, 2017). Uniting the local community by working with the residents and officials to address issues serves as the purpose for this organization. Unearth and Empower provides the lessons that can be used by the residents of the city in order to achieve the transformation so desired. Founded in 2006, The Compton Initiative functions as another such non-profit focused on restoring Compton by painting buildings in the community with the assistance of volunteers (The Compton Initiative, 2018). Painting buildings might seem like a minute action, especially when there appear to be more pressing significant issues that the community faces. The new paint not only restores the neighborhood and beautifies it, but can also be seen as a symbol for the re-birth of a city that has faced such hardships in the past. As fresh paint is an outwardly expression of the new hope for the future, and the act itself further brings the community together. 

The current issues and progression occurring in Compton are intricately tied to its history. Largely forgotten, the city embodied the ideal suburban neighborhood with a flourishing industrial job sector. The perception of Compton remains closely linked to the gangs, violence, and other issues the city faced in the 80’s. A perception that the media continuously reinforces by focusing on any crime that does occur in the city. These views of Compton poison not only the city itself but the self-perception of its residents. The city has experienced a large change not only with its new demographic shift, but also the decrease in violence and the initiatives of the members of the community to transform the city. New buildings and housing developments are bluntly juxtaposed next to the empty buildings that still dot the sides of the main streets. Walking past the old and new buildings you’ll find murals that begin to create a fresh appearance for the city. Residents continue to face unemployment and the poverty that accompanies it. This city still remains starkly different from that of the idealistic city one imagines when they think of the “American Dream”. Though Compton remains stuck between a crime ridden city and a pleasant suburbia, its residents steadfastly continue towards their goal of restoring the city to the attractive nature of its past.
